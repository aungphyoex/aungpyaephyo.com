### What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that allows users to store, share, and collaborate on code. It provides a web-based interface that uses Git, an open-source version control software.

### Key Concepts

- **Repositories**: A repository contains all of your code, files, and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository.

- **Commit**: A commit in GitHub is a snapshot of a project's state at a specific point in time and is a fundamental building block of a Git project's timeline.

- **Branch**: A branch in GitHub is a pointer to a snapshot of changes in a repository.

### Prerequisites

- Pre-install Ubuntu 24.04
- Sudo user with admin rights
- GitHub account

### Update Your System

Update your system with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

Upgrade your system with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

### Install Git on Ubuntu 24.04

Now, you can install Git on Ubuntu 24.04 with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

Press ‘Y’ when prompted to confirm the installation. The system will automatically download and install Git and its dependencies.

After the installation, confirm the Git version by running the following command:

```bash
git --version
```

If the installation is successful, the Git version will be displayed on your terminal:

```bash
git --version
git version 2.43.0
```

### Configure Git

To use Git, it is recommended to configure your identity first. Replace "Name" and "email address" in the commands below with your details:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Aung Pyae Phyo"
git config --global user.email "hi@aungpyaephyo.com"
```

Log your Git config in your terminal by running the following command:

```bash
cat .gitconfig
```

Your Git config will be displayed on your terminal.

### Create a Folder and Initialize a Git Repository

Now, let’s create a new folder for your project and initialize a Git repository. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project folder and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir "project_name"
cd "project_name"
git init
```

The default Git branch will be `master`. You can rename it to `main` by running the following command:

```bash
git branch -M main
```

You can set the default branch to 'main' to reduce the need for switching branches. Use the following command:

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch <defaultBranch>
```

### Make Changes and Commit

After making your changes, commit them to the Git repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'first commit'
```

This command stages all changes (using `git add .`) and commits them with a message describing the changes.

### Create a GitHub Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new repository.
3. Enter your repository name.
4. Choose your access level (public or private).
5. Click "Create Repository."

You will then receive a set of instructions for the repository.

### Generate an SSH Key from Ubuntu 24.04

Run the following command in the terminal to generate an SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

After running the command, follow the prompts:

```shell
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/typle/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/typle/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/typle/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:xtO3i6SViPi+AuJv6Ie/M03lFUx8iKVcERFWUDeGspM typle@lenovo
The key's randomart image is:
+--[RSA 2048]--+
|        *@Xo.+   |
|      ..+* oo .  |
|       o  *      |
|       o E       |
|      o S o .    |
|. .  o + o o .   |
|..o.+ . . + .    |
| + =.o   + . .   |
|..=++o+.. . .    |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Now, copy the content of your public key by running the following command:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Paste it into your GitHub account for authentication:

1. Go to GitHub settings.
2. Go to "SSH and GPG keys."
3. Click "New SSH key."
4. Add your title.
5. Select the key type as "Authentication Key."
6. Add your SSH key.

### Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repository and SSH keys, follow the instructions provided on the repository page to connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository. This typically involves adding a remote URL:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:aungpyaephyo1412/project_name.git
git remote -v
```

### Push Changes to the GitHub Repository

Finally, push your local changes to the GitHub repository by running the following command:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

You can now view your code in your GitHub repository.
